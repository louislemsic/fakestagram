# Fakestagram
An android app replicating the well known app called Instagram using RecyclerView and implementing the heart react button animation. This project was created for educational purposes only and does not intend to damage Instagram's properties.

## Features
* The app utilizes the class RecyclerView to load each content instead of hardcoding everything.
* This was accomplished with the use of an Adapter and a ViewHolder.
* Each content is inside an ArrayList of a class named Post. This makes everything easy in loading them in the adapter.
* The heart react animation when you double tap the image is also implemented in this app.
